The goal is to enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.
The idea is to compare the baseline model with the svc model and decision tree classifier model. 

## Implementation 
1. Read emerging_markets_ohlcv.csv with market data details such as open, close, high, low , volume 
2. Clearn the data , calculate actual returns 
3. Generate trading signals using short window = 4 and long window =100
4. calculate statergy returns 
5. Split the data to test & training data 
6. scale the data 
7. Use SVC classifier model, fit & predict & calculate statergic returns 
8. Use decision Tree classifier model, fit & predict & calculate statergic returns 
9. Compare the new models with baseline .
